The game of life is an experiment that has facinated millions. It is a keystone of complexity theory, demonstrating how a simple set of rules, can easily allow complex behavior. This system has been used to create text banners, reproducing organisms, a universal turing machene, and even the game of life itself. This simple simulation, while possesing an enourmous devoted community, did not have a place on the web that was pleasing to look at, and seamless to use, so I created gameoflife.xyz to give this community the web playground it deserves. It is intended for demonstrative and causal purposes, and has a number of features that assist with explenation, and experimentation. Check it out for yourself.
