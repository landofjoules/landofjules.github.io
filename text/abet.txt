ABET Assistant was the result of a four person senior design recruited to assist the department professor responsible for overseeing the collection of accreditation data across the Electircal Engineering and Computer Science department. I managed the team and was responsible for the design of the entire front end. The goal of this project was to simplify a tedious, and unorganized accreditation process each professor had to complete using excel files; our client had to manage all of it. The assignment was to use Django to create a tool for professors their data in a more managable way, so that our client could sort through this data using a relational database, which our client much preferred. The tool was produced much to the clients liking, and the project will be moving into production December 2016.
