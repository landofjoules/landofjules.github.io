                            <img class="selfImage-r" src="/img/doet.jpg" alt="The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman" />
<p>What is my definition of UI design? The UI designer is in essence an interpreter. An interpreter is required to be well versed in potentially very different languages, and translate meaning between tongues quickly and fluently. The designer must do the same between the computer and the person. The computer possesses incredible possibilities of which most are aware, but speaks, at its core, a language unrecognizable to even expert programmers. To make the language of machine code accessible to the human programmer, we have languages and compilers, but to make the possibilities of code accessible to the common human, we need a solid UI.</p>
<p>The jnon-linear nature of code means the designer much more than an interpreter. Rather than converting words to words, he converts numeric instructions to a comprehensive experience and tool receptive to the fluid nature of human interaction. He must know and create innovative ways to give people quick and effortless access to the information his product offers. This is why I stress my unusually diverse creativity as one of the strongest selling points for myself as a designer. There is nothing new under the sun; creating something new comes down to seeing what is already there in new ways. I have been complimented by numerous people, in numerous fields, as an idea generating machine, and these ideas are comprehensive and grandiose as often as they are the perfect little solution to the problem or design detail at hand.</p>
<p>My philosophy on design is spelled out wonderfully by Don Norman. Why do we pull on doors that are supposed to be pulled? Using a well-designed application should be as easy and effortless as pouring a cup of tea or opening a door. Ideally, the appearance of the site should guide you to find what you are searching for. This is the essence of Human Centered Design: looking at the psychology of everyday action, and interaction, to build a product that comes naturally to a user.</p>

                            <p><span class="desy">
            ABET Assistant was the result of a four person senior design recruited to assist the department professor responsible for overseeing the collection of accreditation data across the Electircal Engineering and Computer Science department. I managed the team and was responsible for the design of the entire front end. The goal of this project was to simplify a tedious, and unorganized accreditation process each professor had to complete using excel files; our client had to manage all of it. The assignment was to use Django to create a tool for professors their data in a more managable way, so that our client could sort through this data using a relational database, which our client much preferred. The tool was produced much to the clients liking, and the project will be moving into production December 2016.

                            <p>
        The game of life is an experiment that has facinated millions. It is a keystone of complexity theory, demonstrating how a simple set of rules, can easily allow complex behavior. This system has been used to create text banners, reproducing organisms, a universal turing machene, and even the game of life itself. This simple simulation, while possesing an enourmous devoted community, did not have a place on the web that was pleasing to look at, and seamless to use, so I created gameoflife.xyz to give this community the web playground it deserves. It is intended for demonstrative and causal purposes, and has a number of features that assist with explenation, and experimentation. Check it out for yourself.

Liliana Kohann is a passionate, and increadible singer, songwriter, illustrator, and poet. Through silly songs, and deep poems she seeks to make the world a more compassionate and loving place. She is also my beloved mother. Throughout high school and college I contributed a great deal to her needs in web development, illustration, and graphic design. I was an official employee of her Publishing Company, Artpeace Music. If you think that's cute, check out her products and read some of her poems. Her web site was using the Weebly CMS. Custom HTML and CSS edits were frequently needed, as well as set up for e-commerse. I also helped prepare the illustrations of her first published book <i>A Thin Book of Fat Poems</i> for production. Below are linked her official site, and her accredited spin off site, The Healing Poems.
