                            <p>
        The game of life is an experiment that has facinated millions. It is a keystone of complexity theory, demonstrating how a simple set of rules, can easily allow complex behavior. This system has been used to create text banners, reproducing organisms, a universal turing machene, and even the game of life itself. This simple simulation, while possesing an enourmous devoted community, did not have a place on the web that was pleasing to look at, and seamless to use, so I created gameoflife.xyz to give this community the web playground it deserves. It is intended for demonstrative and causal purposes, and has a number of features that assist with explenation, and experimentation. Check it out for yourself.

                            <p>
            ABET Assistant was the result of a four person senior design recruited to assist the department professor responsible for overseeing the collection of accreditation data across the Electircal Engineering and Computer Science department. I managed the team and was responsible for the design of the entire front end. The goal of this project was to simplify a tedious, and unorganized accreditation process each professor had to complete using excel files; our client had to manage all of it. The assignment was to use Django to create a tool for professors their data in a more managable way, so that our client could sort through this data using a relational database, which our client much preferred. The tool was produced much to the clients liking, and the project will be moving into production December 2016.
