Liliana Kohann is a passionate, and increadible singer, songwriter, illustrator, and poet. Through silly songs, and deep poems she seeks to make the world a more compassionate and loving place. She is also my beloved mother. Throughout high school and college I contributed a great deal to her needs in web development, illustration, and graphic design. I was an official employee of her Publishing Company, Artpeace Music. If you think that's cute, check out her products and read some of her poems. Her web site was using the Weebly CMS. Custom HTML and CSS edits were frequently needed, as well as set up for e-commerse. I also helped prepare the illustrations of her first published book <i>A Thin Book of Fat Poems</i> for production. Below are linked her official site, and her award-winning spin off site, The Healing Poems.
